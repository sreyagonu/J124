# Week 4: Homework on Data Visualization

I chose the question: *"On a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA, how many times is it acceptable to get up if you're not in an aisle seat?"* from the Flying Etiquette Survey from FiveThrityEight. The question resonated with me personally as I always worry that I get up too many times during long flights, I would be distrubing too many people. Interestingly, people were more forgiving than I initially thought as most people (296 respondents out of 855 people) said three times, averaging out one bathroom trip every 2 hours.
